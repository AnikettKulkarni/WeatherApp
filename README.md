# WeatherApp
Assumption:
1. I have created UIPageViewController by adding all four locations into it.
2. On app launch for the first, data for metrics, and location will be downloaded all together and stored in local database. From next app launch User can load data from local database.
3. I have not implemented network connection check. 
4. On the home screen user can swipe right to load data for next location. 
5. There is a picker to select year. When user selects year the data for respctive year is shown to user monthly. (Max Temp, Min Temp, Rainfall)
